## Setup & Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd vue-access-management
````

2. **Install dependencies:**

```bash
npm install
```

3. **Create `.env` file in the project root:**

```env
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000/api
```

Modify the URL to match your backend API endpoint.

4. **Run the development server:**

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open your browser at `http://localhost:3000` (or the port shown in terminal).

---

## Usage

* Register a new user on the **Register** page.
* Login with registered credentials on the **Login** page.
* After successful login, you’ll be redirected to the **Dashboard**.
* Use the **Logout** button to clear your session.

---

## Environment Variables

* `VITE_API_BASE_URL`: Base URL for all API calls made with Axios.

Make sure to restart the development server after modifying `.env` files.

---

## Technologies Used

* Vue 3 + Composition API
* Pinia (state management)
* Vue Router (routing)
* Axios (HTTP requests)
* Vite (build tool)
* Scoped CSS with iOS-inspired styling

---

## Folder for API config

`src/api/axios.js` — this file creates and exports an Axios instance used throughout the app.

---

## Notes

* The app expects the backend API to provide `/login`, `/register`, and `/user` endpoints.
* Auth token is stored in `localStorage` and used as a Bearer token for authenticated requests.
* Adjust API routes and token handling as per your backend.
